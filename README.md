Hi, I'm Athif Sayyaf 👋
I am a geospatial researcher specializing in landslide analysis and InSAR applications, based in Mohali, India. My work focuses on understanding geohazard processes through remote sensing techniques, and I'm passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to solve real-world environmental challenges.

What I'm up to 💻
Researching landslide dynamics using InSAR analysis and multi-temporal satellite imagery for hazard assessment in the Himalayas

Developing automated workflows for large-scale InSAR processing using PyGMTSAR and Python on HPC systems

Analyzing erosion patterns in the Chambal Badlands through integrated remote sensing and climatic variable analysis

Contributing to scientific publications on landslide-induced impoundment dynamics (under review at LANDSLIDES) and gully erosion modeling (submitted to CATENA)

Research Interests 🌍
InSAR & SAR Processing - SBAS-InSAR, PS-InSAR applications for ground deformation monitoring

Landslide Hazard Assessment - Spatiotemporal analysis of slope instability and dam formation

Geomorphological Modeling - RUSLE applications, erosion dynamics, and landscape evolution

HPC & Remote Sensing - Large-scale geospatial data processing and machine learning applications

Current Work 🔬
